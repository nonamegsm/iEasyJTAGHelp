1.FIND CLOCK SIGNAL FIRST:
  CLK IN QUALCOMM ALWAYS STARTS FROM 400KHZ (PIC4.jpg)
  CLK IN EXYNOS/BROADCOMM/MARVELL (ROM2 CPU's) ALWAYS STARTS FROM 10 MHz or HIGHER FREQUENCY, WHEN CMD = 0 (PIC2.jpg)
2.FIND CMD SIGNAL:
  CMD IN QUALCOMM ALWAYS STARTS FROM CMD0 (PIC5.jpg/PIC6.jpg) 
  CMD IN EXYNOS/BROADCOMM/MARVELL (ROM2 CPU's) ALWAYS STARTS WITH CMD = 0 (PIC1.jpg/PIC2.jpg)
3.FIND VCCQ VOLTAGE:
  VCCQ IS TYPICALLY OTHER SIDE CMD RESISTOR (1.8V/2.8V)
4.FIND VCC VOLTAGE: 
  MEASURE VOLTAGES ON CAPACITORS NEAR EMMC, SHOULD BE 2.85V OR 3.00V
5.BEST WAY TO FIND DAT0 LINE: CONNECT VCC, VCCQ, CLK, CMD AND TRY TO DETECT EMMC WITH DIFFERENT 
  DAT0 LOCATION UNTIL SUCCESS. DAT0 SIGNAL LOOKS LIKE PIC7.jpg (DAT2-DAT7 SIGNALS CAN BE THE SAME)
