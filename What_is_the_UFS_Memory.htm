<h1>What is the UFS Memory</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Universal Flash Storage</strong>, officially
abbreviated as <strong>UFS</strong>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_storage">flash storage</a> specification
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phones</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronic">consumer
electronic</a> devices. It aims to bring higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer">data transfer</a> speed and
increased reliability to flash memory storage.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">UFS is positioned as a replacement for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMMC">eMMCs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital">SD cards</a>. The electrical
interface for UFS uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-PHY">M-PHY</a>, developed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPI_Alliance">MIPI Alliance</a>, a high speed
serial interface targeting 2.9 Gbit/s per lane with up-scalability to 5.8
Gbit/s per lane. UFS implements a full-duplex serial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LVDS">LVDS</a> interface that scales better to
higher bandwidths than the 8-lane parallel interface of eMMCs. Unlike eMMC,
Universal Flash Storage is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI_architectural_model">SCSI architectural
model</a> and supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Command_Queuing">SCSI Tagged Command
Queuing</a>.</font></p>
<p><strong>Why its so Fast?</strong></p>
<p>At a high-level, UFS moves away from a parallel interface to
differential-signaling serial interface, removing the performance and
manufacturing/routing barriers inherent to eMMC.</p>
<p>Due to the parallel 8-bit interface used for eMMC, read and write operations
are sequential, or half-duplex. The new UFS 2.1 standard has dedicated read and
write paths, allowing for full-duplex operation. Essentially, UFS 2.1 can read
and write simultaneously.</p>

<p><font size="3">The combination of the serial interface and full-duplex data
transfers mean that UFS 2.1 can achieve two to four times the peak bandwidth of
eMMC 5.1 and in a more power-efficient manner. There are already two iterations
of UFS 2.1: high speed-gear2 allows for a peak bandwidth of 5.8 Gbps over two
lanes, while high speed-gear3 has a peak bandwidth of up to 11.6 Gbps over two
lanes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">UFS also utilizes Command Queue (CQ), similar to eMMC 5.1,
allowing it to harness the multi-tasking features of mobile operating systems
and multi-core CPUs. This feature allows multiple read and write commands to be
executed by the UFS device in parallel, significantly increasing command
processing speeds.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>EasyJTAG Plus Box and UFS Memory</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3">EasyJTAG Plus box supports UFS memory connection and basic
operations like. Identification, Multiple LUN access, Reading , Writing, and
access to UFS Memory attributes, configs etc as well. Current operations speed
is limited to 1.5Mb/sec and will be increased in next firmware versions.
Minimal firmware for UFS access is 2.35. There is impossible to gain UFS
support with old hardware revisions ( 1.xx firmwares ). UFS Functions did not
requires any additional activation and available soon in EasyJAG Classic suite.
For connecting UFS chip user need to buy an EasyJTAG UFS socket for necessary
memory chip. Currently exists 3 BGA memory types</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="3">UFS BGA153 (Most common for all phones)</font></li>
<li><font size="3">UFS BGA95 (Samsung Flagship phones)</font></li>
<li><font size="3">UFS BGA254 ( UFS with PLDDR4 memory)</font></li>
